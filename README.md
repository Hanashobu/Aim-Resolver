# aimResolver

## What is the aimResolver?
This program gets the IP address of **any** AIM user.  You simply run the script, type in a valid AIM username (they have to be online), and the program prints out their IP address.  The code is a simple concept and will work for any P2P chat program.  It only took me about a minute or two to make.  

## aimResolver is not working correctly!
In order for aimResolver to work correctly, you must have the **AIM application open**.  Make sure that you are signed in and have any optional **P2P security options disabled** on your end.  Also, make sure that you have a **chat open with the user** that you are trying to resolve.  If the program fails to get a users IP, try to **make sure that you have them added as a contact**, however, this usually is not required.  If it still fails to work, **check which port AIM is using**.  AIM uses port 4000 by default, but **if you have a different port set then the code will not work** unless you change the port number.
