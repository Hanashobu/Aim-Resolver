# Aim Resolver

## What is the Aim Resolver?
This simple program gets the IP address of **any** AIM user.  You simply run the script, type in a valid AIM username (they have to be online), and the program prints out their IP address.  The code is a simple concept and will work for any P2P chat program.  It only took me about a minute to make.  

## Aim Resolver is not working correctly!
In order for aimResolver to work correctly, you must have the **AIM application open**.  Make sure that you are signed in and have any optional **P2P security options disabled** on your end.  Also, make sure that you have a **chat open with the user** that you are trying to resolve.  If the program fails to get a user's IP address, try to **make sure that you have them added as a contact**, however, this is not usually required.  If it still fails to work, **check which port AIM is using**.  AIM uses port 4000 by default, but **if you have a different port set, the code will obviously not work properly** until you change the port number in the script.
